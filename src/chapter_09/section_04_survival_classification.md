## Classification of Cell Fates

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We defined a survival event as a cell that went on
to divide at least twice in the several hours following the applied osmotic
shock. In nearly all of our experiments, cells which did not survive an
osmotic shock exhibited necrosis with loss of phase
contrast, extensive blebbing and bursting of the membrane, and the presence of
dark aggregates at the cell poles. An example field across time is shown below
in @Fig:phase_death where the cells are necrotic. On occasion, we
observed cells which did not obviously display the aforementioned death criteria
yet did not undergo one or two division events. These cells were not
counted in our experiments and were not included in the final tally of
survival versus death. Across our 2822 single cell measurements, such “no
call” classifications were observed only 83 times, constituting only 3\% of
the total cell measurements. A breakdown of all classification types and
their respective abundances can be seen in Table 9.1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess the validity of our morphology-based
classification scheme, we performed a subset of the osmotic shock experiments
described in the manuscript using propidium iodide staining to mark cells
which had compromised membranes, identifying them as dead. Briefly, cells
expressing on average $\approx$ 80 MscL channels per cell were grown in LB + 500
mM NaCl to an OD$_{600\text{nm}}$ of approximately 0.25. The cells were then mounted in
the flow cell as described in the Materials and Methods in the main text and
subjected to a large osmotic shock. After the shock, the cells were monitored
for two hours. The propidium iodide stain (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Cell Viability Staining, Thermo Fisher)
was then passed into the flow chamber and imaged. An example of image of the phase contrast and
propidium iodide fluorescence images are shown in @Fig:pi_death. We note
that cells matching our death criteria,  meaning loss of phase
contrast and visible distortion of the cell membrane, were strongly marked
with propidium iodide, confirming that these cells were dead. The
few example of “no call” classification where survival or death could not be
determined from morphology alone showed that these cells were in fact dead
(see highlighted row in @Fig:pi_death). Cells that went on to divide two or
more times in this period were not significantly stained with propidium
iodide, confirming their viability and effectiveness of the stain itself.
Given this data set, we compared the classification breakdown using our
morphology-based method with the conclusive results from the propidium iodide
staining (Table 9.2). We found that the two approaches to defining death
agreed within 1\%. This agreement leads us to believe that our definition of
cell survival as morphological regularity and sustained cell growth is
sufficiently accurate to draw physiological conclusions from our experiments.

time (columns). The final column corresponds to fluorescence from propidium
iodide. Bright fluorescence indicates intercalation with DNA indicating cell
death. Classification of survival based only from morphology is shown as text
in the final column. Highlighted row indicates a “no call” event where
morphology alone could not be used to determine survival or death.
