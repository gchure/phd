## Abstract
Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack
simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable
parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present
a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the
Monod-Wyman- Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the
ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the
behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA
binding strengths, and then constructing and measuring their response. Our
model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains,
but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as
the dynamic range and [EC$_{50}$]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free
energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental
data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of
the induction profiles.
