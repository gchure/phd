## On Molecular Biophysics, Evolutionary Dynamics, and Biophysical Darwinism 

From archaea thriving in hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor to aspen trees
dominating a Coloradan mountainside, all forms of life are unified in their
obedience to the forces of evolution. The influence of these forces is
ubiquitous across life, shaping 3.5 billions of years of speciation
[@darwin1860; @woese1977; @woese1990; @hug2016], minutes- to hours-long cell
differentiation programs, and nanosecond-scale conformational changes of
proteins alike. Despite the enormous breadth in spatial and temporal scales,
each of these examples represent adaptive processes which are central to any
definition of Life.
