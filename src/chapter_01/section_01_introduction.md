## Introduction

From archaea thriving in hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor to aspen trees
dominating a Coloradan mountainside, all forms of life are unified in their
obedience to the forces of evolution. The influence of evolution is ubiquitous
across life, shaping 3.5 billions of years of speciation, the minutes- to
hours-long cell differentiation and proliferating during development, and
nanosecond-scale conformational changes of proteins alike. Despite the enormous
breadth in spatial and temporal scales, each of these examples represent
adaptive behavior which is central to any definition of Life. 


![**The spatial, temporal, and mechanistic scale of
adaptation.** (A) Molecular adaptation in this work is defined through the lens of allostery where the activity of a protein complex is modulated the reversible binding of a small molecule. These binding and unbinding events lead to rapid changes in protein conformation whose behavoir (both energetic and temporal) is comparable to that of thermal motion. (B) Physiological adaptation here is defined as the rewiring of biochemical reaction networks that lead to changes in cellular behavior (such as chemotaxis) or metabolic capacity (such as aerobic to fermentative metabolism). (C) Evolutionary adaptation is recorded in the variation in the genetic sequence of regulatory molecules. Variations in sequence influence the function of the proteins and RNAs they encode which ultimately define the cellular fitness.](ch1_fig1){#fig:adaptation_levels short-caption="The spatial,
temporal, and mechanistic scale of adaptation."}

The central aim of this dissertation is to explore how evolutionary and physiological adaptation are manifest in the molecular details of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. While the bulk of the experimental work presented here uses the molecules of the *lac* operon from *Escherichia coli*,
