## Introduction

From archaea thriving in hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor to aspen trees
dominating a Coloradan mountainside, all forms of life are unified in their
obedience to the forces of evolution. The influence of these forces is
ubiquitous across life, shaping 3.5 billions of years of speciation
[@darwin1860; @woese1977; @woese1990; @hug2016], minutes- to hours-long cell
differentiation programs, and nanosecond-scale conformational changes of
proteins alike. Despite the enormous breadth in spatial and temporal scales,
each of these examples represent adaptive processes which are central to any
definition of Life. 

The central aim of this dissertation is to explore the biophysical mechanisms
by which these levels of adaptation -- molecular, physiological, and
evolutionary, schematized in @Fig:adaptation_levels -- are interconnected.
While one may be able to qualitatively explain how variations at the level of
DNA or protein sequence manifest in organismal or population scale effects,
this work takes a quantitative approach seeking to use simple principles from
statistical physics to *predict* biological phenomenology. 


In this chapter (**Chapter 1**), 


In **Chapter 2**, we build a theoretical framework to understand the inducible
simple repression regulatory architecture. This work is the product of a
years-long experiment in scientific socialism, demarcated by the presence of
five co-first authors. These co-first authors and now dear friends include
Nathan M. Belliveau, Stephanie L. Barnes, Manuel Razo-Mejia, and Tal Einav. 



Given a well-defined theoretical framework, we explore the adaptive behavior of
the simple repression motif in an evolutionary context in **Chapter 3**.


**Chapter 4** builds on this to dissect the physiological adaptability of this
simple genetic circuit. While the results are condensed into a handful of
figures, it represents nearly two years worth of microscopy and quantitative
image analysis, much of which was collected by Zofii A. Kaczmarek, a remarkable
young scientist. 


Finally, in **Chapter 5**, we examine adaptability where it counts. Heun Jin


The remaining chapters (**Chapters 6 - 9**) provide a detailed body of
supplemental information 


Before we enter the nitty-gritty of this dissertation, we will first explore a
brief history of the concept of *enzymatic adaptation* -- a curious observation
of bacterial growth which opened the door to a new era of biolgical discovery in
the latter-half of the twentieth century. 

![**The spatial, temporal, and mechanistic scale of
adaptation.** (A) Molecular adaptation in this work is defined through the lens of allostery where the activity of a protein complex is modulated the reversible binding of a small molecule. These binding and unbinding events lead to rapid changes in protein conformation whose behavior (both energetic and temporal) is comparable to that of thermal motion. (B) Physiological adaptation here is defined as the rewiring of biochemical reaction networks that lead to changes in cellular behavior (such as chemotaxis) or metabolic capacity (such as aerobic to fermentative metabolism). (C) Evolutionary adaptation is recorded in the variation in the genetic sequence of regulatory molecules. Variations in sequence influence the function of the proteins and RNAs they encode which ultimately define the cellular fitness.](ch1_fig1){#fig:adaptation_levels short-caption="The spatial,
