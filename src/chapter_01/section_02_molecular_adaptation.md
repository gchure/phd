## Topic I: The Janus Face of Molecules

Famously referred to by Monod as "the second secret of life" [@monod1965],
allosteric regulation is ubiquitous in biological systems, governing the
behavior of ion channels [@einav2017, @auerbach2012a], enzymatic reactions
[@einav2016], chemotaxis [@swem2008, @keymer2006], and especially in
transcriptional regulation [@huang2018, @lindsley2006a].
