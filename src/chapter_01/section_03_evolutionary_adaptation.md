## Topic II: Using Free Energy to Examine Evolutionary Adaptation

As summarized in the previous section and discussed in depth in Chapter 2,
**Chapter 3** and the associated supplemental **Chapter 7** of this dissertation
focus on the influence of mutation within the allosteric transcription factor.
Furthermore, **Chapter 3** presents a generic mechanism by which shifts in the
free energy can be mapped directly to changes in values of the biophysical
parameters. This chapter, much like Chapter 2, was borne out of a wonderful
collaboration with Manuel Razo-Mejia, Stephanie L. Barnes, Nathan M. Belliveau,
Tal Einav, and Zofii A. Kaczmarek. Being able to collaborate with stellar array
of scientists allowed me to develop the free energy framework described in the
previous section and collect enough data to test the theory.
