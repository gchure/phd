Of the many pages in this thesis, this small section is the most difficult to
write. This difficulty doesn't come from thinking of *who* to acknowledge.
Rather, it comes from the crushing fear of leaving someone out. The past
seven years have been some of the most satisfying of my life, both from an
intellectual and emotional standpoint. If you're reading this and are hurt
you aren't mentioned, please forgive me -- your absence comes from the
fragility of human memory rather than from a place of malice.

Rob Phillips, my Ph.D. adviser, is a man who escapes description. As such, it
feels impossible to properly convey my gratitude for his mentorship and, more
importantly, his friendship.  

His unceasing desire and unique ability to pursue
the physical reality of any problem has shaped how I approach scientific


Aside from Rob, Justin Bois has perhaps had the strongest influence on my scientific
philosophy. Throughout my Ph.D., he has been both a dear friend and statistical
shaman. His remarkable ability to teach the complex details of statistical
inference, physical biology, and computer program transformed the way I consider
and approach biological questions.

I owe a great deal of my development as a scientist to those with whom I've
shared the lab. Heun Jin Lee is a master of all things precise and served as
someone I could go to for advice on any topic ranging from the scientific to
the deeply personal. His dedication to writing down theory and performing
experiments and theory with extreme care has shaped my impression of how
science should be performed and, just as importantly, communicated. I
interacted closely with Heun Jin on nearly all of my research projects and
had the immense pleasure coauthoring a paper with which is presented in
Chapter 5 of this thesis. Heun Jin tirelessly performed all experiments in
this chapter and provided detailed advice and supervision during the data
analysis, drafting, and revision process.

Alongside Heun Jin, I've had the pleasure to be coauthors with Manuel
Razo-Mejia, Soichi Hirokawa, Muir Morrison, Zofii Kaczmarek, Nathan Belliveau,
Stephanie Barnes, and Tal Einav. Soichi and Muir have faithfully served as my
office-mates for the past six years and have served as a sounding board for many
of the ideas presented in this thesis. Muir and Soichi's deep knowledge of
physics helped me develop the physical intuition I have today and I will forever
owe them for the time they took out of their days help me understand my science.
Manuel and Nathan are those who I've spent the most time with at the bench, the
whiteboard, and hunched over the keyboard. Alongside Soichi and Muir, they have
helped me figure out what makes a good experiment and what makes a bad theory
(and vice-versa). Stephanie and Zofii, both stellar scientists in their own
right, also served as a reminder of how creative expression is as important as
scientific rigor. Tal Einav, a Phillips' lab alumnus who needs no introduction,
has taught me much about the nature of collaboration over the years. 

Suzy Beeler, though I never had the pleasure of listing as a coauthor, has
always someone I could turn to when in need of scientific advice or personal
support. Her ability to cut through the bullshit and provide an honest
opinion, either scientific or personal has proven to be invaluable over the
years. Bill Ireland, Rachel Banks, Rebecca Rousseau, Vahe Galstyan, Niko
McCarty, Tom R\"{o}schinger, Molly Bassette, Jonathan Gross, Celene Barrera,
Matthias Rydenfelt, Gita Mahmoudabadi, and Daniel Jones are others who are or
have since left the group to whom I am grateful for their scientific
discussions over the years.

Some of my most cherished memories of graduate school stem from my time at the
Marine Biological Laboratory, an institution where suspension of disbelief is
the rule rather than the exception. While I never took a course, I
had the immense privilege of being a teaching assistant for the Physiology
summer course from 2015 to 2018 and for Physical Biology of the Cell course in 2018. 
During this time, I met dozens of graduate students, professors, post
docs, research technicians, and more who have all helped me develop as a scientist
and educator. In no particular order, I would like to Celine
Akelmide, George Bell, Ambika Nadkarni, Damien Dudka, Cat Triandifiliou, Mason
Kamb, Lizzy Mueller, Chandrima Patra, Miranda Hunter, Kyle Naughton, Cayla
Jewett, Emily Meltzer, Roya Huang, Charlotte Strankvist, Simon Alamos, Sean
McInally, Karna Gowda, Alina Guna, Nalin Ratinyake, Joe Brzostowski, Carolynn
Ott, Steven Wilbert, Ana Gayek, Wallace Marshall, and all of those who have
passed through the halls of Loeb Lab with me for forging so many great memories.
During these courses, I had the pleasure to teach alongside Rob Brewster, Hernan
Garcia, James Boedicker, and Franz Weinert who all passed through Rob's lab in
their own right. As I taught alongside them, I learned enough from them to be
qualified as yet another one of their students.



While my academics have been focused on the things that are small and alive,
I have had a life-long love affair with paleontology where the subjects are
often big and always dead. This comes from the opportunities provided to me
by Mom and Dad, Lorraine and Dan Chure. Dan and Lorraine Chure. During my
father’s 38 years as the chief paleontologist at Dinosaur National Monument
in Utah, he instilled in me a curiosity for the natural world and its long,
tumultuous biological history. My childhood and adolescent years are peppered
with fond memories of hiking across the rugged Utah deserts, scanning exposed
layers of sandstone for the tell-tale signs of a 200 million year old
graveyard. On the weekends, I would work alongside my father at active dig
sites, chipping away at the rock hoping to uncover some pieces that help fill
in the puzzle of the life history of Earth. The weekdays, however, were spent
in the public education system of rural Utah where evolution was a hoax and
dinosaur bones were buried by either the devil or the government (or
sometimes both). Their commitment to giving me a scientific education is why
I'm here 20 years later writing a section of my doctoral thesis. Their
unwavering support of my interests and passions (from skateboarding and death
metal to coffee and bread baking) have helped pull me through tough parts of
grad school and have taught me to savor the good.   




Stephen Jay Gould, one of my scientific heroes, once wrote "I am, somehow,
less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in
the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton
fields and sweatshops." This is a quote that has stuck with me since I first
read it in middle school. The enormous privilege I have had throughout my
life is not lost on me. I write this paragraph as someone with a home with fresh food
and running water. As someone with loving family and friends. As someone who
is being paid to do what he loves. The physical, emotional, and intellectual
security I have been so lucky to have comes at some level at the cost of
others.

We stand on the shoulders of giants. These giants are nameless and
enumerable. For a section of this work dedicated to naming those to whom I am
indebted, I want to close it with thanking all those who to me are nameless.
To those who lived a harsher life to build a better one for people like me.
To those who were more courageous in fighting injustice and cruelty than I.
To those who lived and died in dire straits simply because of who they were,
where they were born, or what they believed in. This is a debt that can never
be repaid, but I hope that I can at least give to the future a fraction of what 
they gave to me.
