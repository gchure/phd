Of the many pages in this thesis, this part somehow feels the most difficult to
write. This difficulty doesn't come from thinking of *who* to acknowledge.
Rather, it comes from the crushing fear of leaving someone out. The past seven years have
been some of the most satisfying of my life, both from an intellectual and
emotional standpoint. If you're reading this and are hurt you aren't mentioned,
please forgive me -- your absence comes from the fragility of human memory
rather than from a place of malice. 

Paragraph about Rob. Mention his openness to taking someone who pulled a C+ in
calculus. The time spent with him obviously has sculpted my view of what science
can be, but has also influenced my deep emotional connection to the *pursuit* of
science as a philosophy.

Paragraph about Justin. Likewise, Justin Bois has shaped my view of what it
means to do science. He's also shaped my view of how interesting questions exist
everywhere. Being a good scientist is more than just domain expertise, it is
about having a worldview that permits you to pick observations apart piece by
piece. 

Labmates in no specific order. Suzy, Nathan, Manuel, Muir, Soichi, Heun Jin,
Stephanie, Rob Brewster, Zofii. Tal. Friends in BMB.



MBL and its influence on me as a scientist. A chance to mentor and be mentored
in a place where suspension of disbelief is the rule rather than the exception.
People include (in no particular order) Anna Gayek, Charlotte Strandkvist, Kyle
Naughton, Cat, Joe, Sean, Simon, Hernan, James, George, Celine, Cayla, Emily
Meltzer, Lizzy Mueller, Karna Gowda, Alina Guna. 


Mom and Dad for exposing me to nature from the first moment. Mention they
gifting me books (the big book of why) for my first Christmas (5 months old).
For teaching me to "never let school get in the way of my education." Mention
the challenges of growing up in rural Utah. 


Barb. Too much to list here for now. *Até enfim!*


A quote has stuck with me as far back as I can remember being introspective
at any meaningful level. Gould "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight
and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people
of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops." The
enormous privilege I have had throughout my life is not lost on me. I
write this as someone with a home with fresh food and running water. As someone
with loving family and friends. As someone who is being paid to do what he loves.
The physical, emotional, and intellectual security I have been so lucky to have
at some level comes at the cost of others. 

"We stand on the shoulders of giants" is a refrain so promiscuously used it
has nearly lost it's meaning. These giants are nameless and enumerable. For a
section of this work dedicated to naming those to whom I am indebted, I want
to close it with thanking all those who to me are nameless. To those who
lived a harsher life to build a better one for people like me. To those who
were more courageous in fighting injustice and cruelty than I. This is a debt
that can never be repaid, but I hope that I can at least give to the future
what they gave to me.
