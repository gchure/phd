  abstract = {Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number\textemdash{}in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle.},

  title = {Quantitative Model for Gene Regulation by {{A}} Phage Repressor},
  abstract = {A statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to account for the cooperative interactions of the bacteriophage A repressor with the A right operator. The model incorporates a general theory for quantitatively interpreting cooperative site-specific equilibrium binding data. Values for all interaction parameters of the model have been evaluated at 37TC, 0.2 M KCI, from results of DNase protection experiments in vitro [A. D. Johnson, B. J. Meyer, \& M. Ptashne, Procx NatL Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76, 5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and PRM that control transcription of genes coding for the regulatory proteins cro and repressor, respectively. At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at Pn is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active. The results demonstrate the importance of cooperative interactions between repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator sites OR' and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic state and in allowing efficient switchover to the lytic state during induction.},

We discuss mutant repressors, which (1) show tighter repression; (2) induce with a previously noninducing species, orthonitrophenyl-{$\beta$}-d-galactoside; and (3) transform an inducible switch to one that is corepressed. The ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants, and hence drastically alter the repressor's phenotype, shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the Lac/Gal family of bacterial repressors.},

Here, we present a genome-wide approach, based on ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

If so, the theoretical tools needed to quantitatively and predictively describe what goes on in such test tubes lag sorely behind the stunning experimental advances in biology seen in the decades since the molecular biology revolution began. Perhaps surprisingly, one of the theoretical tools that has been used with great success on problems ranging from how cells communicate with their environment and each other to the nature of the organization of proteins and lipids within the cell membrane is statistical mechanics. A knee-jerk reaction to the use of statistical mechanics in the description of cellular processes is that living organisms are so far from equilibrium that one has no business even thinking about it. But such reactions are probably too hasty given that there are many regimes in which, because of a separation of timescales, for example, such an approach can be a useful first step. In this article, we explore the power of statistical mechanical thinking in the biological setting, with special emphasis on cell signaling and regulation. We show how such models are used to make predictions and describe some recent experiments designed to test them. We also consider the limits of such models based on the relative timescales of the processes of interest.},

  abstract = {A canonical quantitative view of transcriptional regulation holds that the only role of operator sequence is to set the probability of transcription factor binding, with operator occupancy determining the level of gene expression. In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

The energy required to deform double-helical DNA depends on sequence, and this mechanical code of DNA influences gene regulation, such as through nucleosome positioning. Here we examine the sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA in bacterial transcription factor-mediated looping, a context for which the role of sequence remains poorly understood. Using a suite of synthetic constructs repressed by the Lac repressor and two well-known sequences that show large flexibility differences in vitro, we make precise statistical mechanical predictions as to how DNA sequence influences loop formation and test these predictions using in vivo transcription and in vitro single-molecule assays. Surprisingly, sequence-dependent flexibility does not affect in vivo gene regulation. By theoretically and experimentally quantifying the relative contributions of sequence and the DNA-bending protein HU to DNA mechanical properties, we reveal that bending by HU dominates DNA mechanics and masks intrinsic sequence-dependent flexibility. Such a quantitative understanding of how mechanical regulatory information is encoded in the genome will be a key step towards a predictive understanding of gene regulation at single-base pair resolution.},

  abstract = {The lac-operon and its components have been studied for decades and it is widely used as one of the common systems for recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. However, the role of the lactose permease, encoded by the lacY gene, when using the gratuitous inducer IPTG for the overexpression of heterologous proteins, is still a matter of discussion. A lactose permease deficient strain was successfully constructed. Growing profiles and acetate production were compared with its parent strain at shake flask scale. Our results show that the lac-permease deficient strain grows slower than the parent in defined medium at shake flask scale, probably due to a downregulation of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). The distributions of IPTG in the medium and inside the cells, as well as recombinant protein production were measured by HPLC\textendash{}MS and compared in substrate limiting fed-batch fermentations at different inducer concentrations. For the mutant strain, IPTG concentration in the medium depletes slower, reaching at the end of the culture higher concentration values compared with the parent strain. Final intracellular and medium concentrations of IPTG were similar for the mutant strain, while higher intracellular concentrations than in medium were found for the parent strain. Comparison of the distribution profiles of IPTG of both strains in fed-batch fermentations showed that lac-permease is crucially involved in IPTG uptake. In the absence of the transporter, apparently IPTG only diffuses, while in the presence of lac-permease, the inducer accumulates in the cytoplasm at higher rates emphasizing the significant contribution of the permease-mediated transport.},

  abstract = {Biological systems produce outputs in response to variable inputs. Input-output relations tend to follow a few regular patterns. For example, many chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad constraints.},

  abstract = {Two-component systems, which are comprised of a single histidine-aspartate phosphotransfer module, are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well. A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3--activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3- activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

In this theoretical study, we construct an explicit model for the evolution of regulatory sequences, making use of the known biophysics of the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA sequences, under the assumption that fitness of a sequence depends only on its binding affinity to the regulatory protein. The model is confined to the mean field (i.e., infinite population size) limit. Using realistic values for all parameters, we determine the minimum fitness advantage needed to maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly the "error threshold" below which a binding sequence cannot survive the accumulated effect of mutation over long time. The commonly observed "fuzziness" in binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between selection and mutation in our model. In addition, we devise a simple model for the evolution of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region. We find the number of evolutionarily stable binding sequences to increase in a step-like fashion with increasing fitness advantage, if multiple regulatory proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription. We discuss possible experimental approaches to resolve open questions raised by our study.},

  abstract = {The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli is a dimer made up of identical subunits. Each CRP subunit contains a cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and the CRP dimer exhibits negative cooperativity in binding cAMP. In solutions containing cAMP, CRP undergoes sequential conformation changes from the inactive apo-form through the active CRP:(cAMP)1 complex to the less active CRP:(cAMP)2 complex depending on the cAMP concentration. Apo-CRP binds DNA with low affinity and no apparent sequence specificity. The CRP:(cAMP)1 complex exhibits high affinity, sequence-specific DNA binding and interacts with RNA polymerase, whether free in solution or complexed with DNA. The results of genetic, biochemical and biophysical studies have helped to uncover many of the details of cAMP-mediated allosteric control over CRP conformation and activity as a transcription factor. These studies indicate that cAMP binding produces only small, but significant, changes in CRP structure; changes that include subunit realignment and concerted motion of the secondary structure elements within the C-terminal DNA binding domain of each subunit. These adjustments promote CRP surface-patch interaction with RNA polymerase and protrusion of the F-helix to promote CRP site-specific interaction with DNA. Interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase at CRP-dependent promoters produce active ternary transcription complexes.},

  abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

  abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting ``system-level'' properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702\textendash{}7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

  abstract = {Many allosteric proteins form homo-oligomeric complexes to regulate a biological function. In homo-oligomers, subunits establish communication pathways that are modulated by external stimuli like ligand binding. A challenge for dissecting the communication mechanisms in homo-oligomers is identifying intermediate liganded states, which are typically transiently populated. However, their identities provide the most mechanistic information on how ligand-induced signals propagate from bound to empty subunits. Here, we dissected the directionality and magnitude of subunit communication in a reengineered single-chain version of the homodimeric transcription factor cAMP receptor protein. By combining wild-type and mutant subunits in various asymmetric configurations, we revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of cooperative effects and the number of mutant subunits. We found that a single mutation is sufficient to change the global allosteric behavior of the dimer even when one subunit was wild type. Dimers harboring two mutations with opposite cooperative effects had different allosteric properties depending on the arrangement of the mutations. When the two mutations were placed in the same subunit, the resulting cooperativity was neutral. In contrast, when placed in different subunits, the observed cooperativity was dominated by the mutation with strongest effects over cAMP affinity relative to wild type. These results highlight the distinct roles of intrasubunit interactions and intersubunit communication in allostery. Finally, dimers bound to either one or two cAMP molecules had similar DNA affinities, indicating that both asymmetric and symmetric liganded states activate DNA interactions. These studies have revealed the multiple communication pathways that homo-oligomers employ to transduce signals.},

  abstract = {The acknowledged success of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model stems from its efficacy in accounting for the functional behavior of many complex proteins starting with hemoglobin (the paradigmatic case) and extending to channels and receptors. The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R\textendash{}T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box\textendash{}Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis. \textcopyright{} 2008 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

The evaluation of the antibacterial activity for the microdiluition in broth technique. \textbf{Results:} The MIC and MBC result for the ethanolic extract was 2.0 mg/mL. For the dichloromethane extract and ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, MIC was {$>$}2.0 mg/mL, but no bactericidal activity (MBC) was observed. The FIC values achieved with the combinatioin of the crude extracts with clavulanic acid were not significantly different. \textbf{Conclusion:} The ethanolic extract from \emph{Miconia rubiginosa} exhibits better antibacterial activity, but the two isolated compounds are not active against the tested bacterial isolates. The combination of the crude extracts with clavulanic acid does not lead to synergism, and there are no statistical differences between the two crude extracts in this sense.},

With the use of statistical mechanics, the mathematical implementation of the MWC concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand\textendash{}receptor binding, ligand-gated ion channels, chemotaxis, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the MWC model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of MWC molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of MWC molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the ``design'' constraints faced by these receptors.},

  abstract = {Physiological and evolutionary adaptations operate at very different time scales. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe there should be a strong relationship between the two, as together they modify the phenotype. Physiological adaptations change phenotype by altering certain microscopic parameters; evolutionary adaptation can either alter genetically these same parameters or others to achieve distinct or similar ends. Although qualitative discussions of this relationship abound, there has been very little quantitative analysis. Here, we use the hemoglobin molecule as a model system to quantify the relationship between physiological and evolutionary adaptations. We compare measurements of oxygen saturation curves of 25 mammals with those of human hemoglobin under a wide range of physiological conditions. We fit the data sets to the Monod\textendash{}Wyman\textendash{}Changeux model to extract microscopic parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological and evolutionary change act on different parameters. The main parameter that changes in the physiology of hemoglobin is relatively constant in evolution, whereas the main parameter that changes in the evolution of hemoglobin is relatively constant in physiology. This orthogonality suggests continued selection for physiological adaptability and hints at a role for this adaptability in evolutionary change.},

  issn = {0027-8424, 1091-6490},
  abstract = {Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoters and other regulatory regions is essential for precise gene expression. The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TF sites in regulatory regions. Recent genomic and functional studies, however, demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of TF sites located in cis-regulatory regions. Such flexibility is inconsistent with cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here, we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among noninteracting TFs can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is analogous to cooperativity in another multimolecular complex: hemoglobin. This surprising analogy provides deep insights, with parallels between the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g., the Bohr effect) and the roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene expression. Nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is consistent with several experimental studies, is equally applicable to repressors and activators, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of regulatory regions, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in transcriptional regulation point to a general mechanism that can be used in various biological systems.},

A multidisciplinary approach, involving mathematical and computational modeling in parallel with experimentation, is often crucial for gaining such insights and improving the efficiency of artificial gene network design. Here we used such an approach and developed a combinatorial promoter design strategy to characterize how the position and multiplicity of tetO2 operator sites within the GAL1 promoter affect gene expression levels and gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed stronger transcriptional repression and higher gene expression noise as a single operator site was moved closer to the TATA box, whereas for multiple operator-containing promoters, we found that the position and number of operator sites together determined the dose\textendash{}response curve and gene expression noise. We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental\textendash{}computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts.},

We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators. A short distance of 92 bp allows effective repression by two very weak operators (O3, O3). The cooperativity of lac operators is discussed in terms of a local increase of repressor concentration. This increase in concentration depends on flexible DNA which allows loop formation.},

We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E.~coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG.

  abstract = {Tight and tunable control of gene expression is a highly desirable goal in synthetic biology for constructing predictable gene circuits and achieving preferred phenotypes. Elucidating the sequence\textendash{}function relationship of promoters is crucial for manipulating gene expression at the transcriptional level, particularly for inducible systems dependent on transcriptional regulators. Sort-seq methods employing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and high-throughput sequencing allow for the quantitative analysis of sequence\textendash{}function relationships in a robust and rapid way. Here we utilized a massively parallel sort-seq approach to analyze the formaldehyde-inducible Escherichia coli promoter (Pfrm) with single-nucleotide resolution. A library of mutated formaldehyde-inducible promoters was cloned upstream of gfp on a plasmid. The library was partitioned into bins via FACS on the basis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression level, and mutated promoters falling into each expression bin were identified with high-throughput sequencing. The resulting analysis identified two 19 base pair repressor binding sites, one upstream of the -35 RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding site and one overlapping with the -10 site, and assessed the relative importance of each position and base therein. Key mutations were identified for tuning expression levels and were used to engineer formaldehyde-inducible promoters with predictable activities. Engineered variants demonstrated up to 14-fold lower basal expression, 13-fold higher induced expression, and a 3.6-fold stronger response as indicated by relative dynamic range. Finally, an engineered formaldehyde-inducible promoter was employed to drive the expression of heterologous methanol assimilation genes and achieved increased biomass levels on methanol, a non-native substrate of E. coli.},

When the number of TFs heavily exceeds the number of binding sites, TF binding to each promoter can be regarded as independent. However, when the number of TF molecules is comparable to the number of binding sites, TF titration will result in correlation (``promoter entanglement'') between transcription of different genes. We develop a statistical mechanical model which takes the TF titration effect into account and use it to predict both the level of gene expression for a general set of promoters and the resulting correlation in transcription rates of different genes. Our results show that the TF titration effect could be important for understanding gene expression in many regulatory settings.},

We found an unexpectedly intricate function with four plateau levels and four thresholds. This result compares well with a mathematical model of the binding of the regulatory proteins cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and LacI to the lac regulatory region. The model is also used to demonstrate that with few mutations, the same region could encode much purer AND-like or even OR-like functions. This possibility means that the wild-type region is selected to perform an elaborate computation in setting the transcription rate.

  abstract = {In prokaryotes, the construction of synthetic, multi-input promoters is constrained by the number of transcription factors that can simultaneously regulate a single promoter. This fundamental engineering constraint is an obstacle to synthetic biologists because it limits the computational capacity of engineered gene circuits. Here, we demonstrate that complex multi-input transcriptional logic gating can be achieved through the use of ligand-inducible chimeric transcription factors assembled from the LacI/GalR family. These modular chimeras each contain a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, both of which are chosen from a library of possibilities. When two or more chimeras have the same DNA-binding domain, they independently and simultaneously regulate any promoter containing the appropriate operator site. In this manner, simple transcriptional AND gating is possible through the combination of two chimeras, and multiple-input AND gating is possible with the simultaneous use of three or even four chimeras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that orthogonal DNA-binding domains and their cognate operators allow the coexpression of multiple, orthogonal AND gates. Altogether, this work provides synthetic biologists with novel, ligand-inducible logic gates and greatly expands the possibilities for engineering complex synthetic gene circuits.},

Here we use in vitro transcription to directly mimic the in vivo system in order to build a self consistent set of experiments to directly compare in vivo and in vitro genetic repression.

An accurate measurement of repressor, DNA and effector concentrations were made both in vivo and in vitro allowing for direct modeling of the entire thermodynamic equilibrium. In vivo repression profiles are accurately predicted from the given in vitro parameters when molecular crowding is considered. Interestingly, our measured repressor\textendash{}operator DNA affinity differs significantly from previous in vitro measurements. The literature values are unable to replicate in vivo binding data. We therefore conclude that the repressor-DNA affinity is much weaker than previously thought. This finding would suggest that in vitro techniques that are specifically designed to mimic the in vivo process may be necessary to replicate the native system.},

Sometimes, even, they reveal cracks in the smooth surface of current dogma and hint at unexplored layers beneath. Take, for example, the question of the ``gain'' or ``amplification'' shown by swimming bacteria when they respond to chemical attractants. Arguments about the size of this gain and whether it is consistent with the currently accepted model of signal transduction have been going on for years. Now, an innovative technique applied to the problem measures chemotactic gain with unparalleled accuracy (1). And yes, there really is something strange going on.

The story begins 30 years ago when Howard Berg and Douglas Brown at the University of Colorado used a novel three-dimensional tracking microscope they had developed to follow the swimming of individual Escherichia coli bacteria (2). Swimming was found to consist of smooth ``runs'' interrupted roughly every second by transient ``tumbles'' (or ``twiddles''). Chemotaxis\textemdash{}the ability of the cells to move toward distant sources of food molecules\textemdash{}was based on the suppression of tumbles in cells that happened by chance to be moving up the gradient. The impressive sensitivity of this process was later measured by applying attractants such as aspartate directly from a pipette onto bacteria tethered onto a coverslip (3). In this tethered-cell method, periodic reversals of rotation of individual flagellar motors are observed and the swimming performance recorded as the rotational bias \textemdash{}the fraction of time spent in counterclockwise rotation. The measurements of Segall et al. (3) revealed that the amplification, or gain, of \ldots{}},

LuxN, a nine-transmembrane domain protein from Vibrio harveyi, is the founding example of membrane-bound receptors for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of dose-response curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified. We find that quorum-sensing-mediated communication can be manipulated positively and negatively to control bacterial behavior and, more broadly, that signaling parameters can be deduced from in vivo data.},

In this study, the correlation between thermodynamic measurements of in vitro DNA binding affinity with in vivo transcription repression was investigated for two transcription repressors. In the first system, which comprised an engineered LacI/GalR homolog, mutational changes altered the equilibrium constant for binding DNA. Changes correlated with altered repression, but estimates of in vivo repressor concentration suggest a {$\geq$}25-fold discrepancy with in vitro conditions. In the second system, changes in ligand binding to BirA altered dimerization and subsequent DNA occupancy. Again, these changes correlate with altered in vivo repression, but comparison with in vitro measurements reveals a \textasciitilde{}10-fold discrepancy. Further analysis of each system suggests that the observed discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results reflect the contributions of additional equilibria to the transcription repression process.},

  abstract = {The 306-kDa aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well studied regulatory enzyme, and it has emerged as a paradigm for understanding allostery and cooperative binding processes. Although there is a consensus that the cooperative binding of active site ligands follows the Monod\textendash{}Wyman\textendash{}Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, there is some debate about the binding of effectors such as ATP and CTP and how they influence the allosteric equilibrium between R and T states of the enzyme. In this article, the binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotides is studied, along with their effect on the R\textendash{}T equilibrium by using highly deuterated, 1H,13C-methyl-labeled protein in concert with methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR. Although only the T state of the enzyme can be observed in spectra of wild-type unliganded aspartate transcarbamoylase, binding of active-site substrates shift the equilibrium so that correlations from the R state become visible, allowing the equilibrium constant (L{${'}$}) between ligand-saturated R and T forms of the enzyme to be measured quantitatively. The equilibrium constant between unliganded R and T forms (L) also is obtained, despite the fact that the R state is ``invisible'' in spectra, by means of an indirect process that makes use of relations that emerge from the fact that ligand binding and the R\textendash{}T equilibrium are linked. Titrations with MgATP unequivocally establish that its binding directly perturbs the R\textendash{}T equilibrium, consistent with the Monod\textendash{}Wyman\textendash{}Changeux model. This study emphasizes the utility of modern solution NMR spectroscopy in understanding protein function, even for systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds of kilodaltons.},

Here, we study this process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with and without looping. Within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon, we show that regulation based on DNA looping, in addition to increasing the repression level, can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and, at the same time, decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins. Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate the average properties of transcription and its fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The basic methodology for designing, altering, and constructing biological systems is increasingly relying on well-established engineering principles to move forward from trial and error approaches to reliably predicting the system behavior from the properties of the components and their interactions. The inherent complexity of even the simplest biological systems, however, often precludes achieving such predictive power. A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups. The reason is the pervasive complex hierarchy of events involved in gene regulation that extend from specific protein\textendash{}DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we integrate such complexity into a few-parameter model to accurately predict gene expression from a few simple rules to connect the parts. The model accurately reproduces the observed transcriptional activity of the lac operon over a 10,000-fold range for 21 different operator setups, different repressor concentrations, and tetrameric and dimeric forms of the repressor. Incorporation of the calibrated model into more complex scenarios accurately captures the induction curves for key operator configurations and the temporal evolution of the {$\beta$}-galactosidase activity of cell populations.},

However, for a receptor with more than one ligand binding site, the Hill equation does not reflect a physically possible reaction scheme; only under the very specific condition of marked positive cooperativity does the Hill coefficient accurately estimate the number of binding sites. The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an "interaction" coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand-receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand-receptor interaction is available.},

Allostery is the most direct, rapid, and efficient regulatory mechanism to sense changes in the concentration of small molecules and alter cellular responses to maintain homeostasis.
