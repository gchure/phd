### Scaling of Gene Expression With Growth Rate

Given the single-cell resolution of our experimental method, we examined
how the cell volume and repressor copy number scaled across the
different growth conditions at different levels of ATC induction. In
agreement with the literature [@schaechter1958; @jun2018; @shehata1975] our measurement reveals a strong linear
dependence of the cell volume on the choice of carbon source, but no
significant dependence on temperature [@Fig:scaling (A) and (B)]. Additionally, these
findings are consistent across different ATC induction regimes.
Together, these observations confirm that the particular details of our
experimental system does not introduce unintended physiological
consequences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a fluorescence calibration factor determined for each experimental
replicate [see @Fig:circuit (C) and the Materials \&
Methods\, we estimated the number of repressors per cell from snapshots
of the mCherry signal intensity of each induction condition. @Fig:scaling (C)
reveals a remarkable insensitivity of the repressor copy number on the growth rate under different carbon
sources. Despite the change in cellular volume, the mean number of
repressors expressed at a given induction condition is within error
between all carbon sources. Previous work using mass spectrometry, a
higher resolution method, has shown that there is a slight dependence of
LacI copy number on growth rate expressed from its native promoter [@schmidt2016]. It
is possible that such a dependence exists in our experimental setup, but
is not detectable with our lower resolution method. We also observe an
insensitivity of copy number to growth rate when the temperature of the
system is tuned [@Fig:scaling (D)], though two
aberrant points with large error obfuscates the presence of a growth
rate dependence at high concentrations of ATC. For concentrations below
7 ng /mL, however, the repressor copy number remains constant across
conditions. With no significant change in the repressor copy number and
thus no dependence on the carbon source in our theoretical model, we are
can immediately draw predictions of the fold-change in gene expression
in different growth media.
