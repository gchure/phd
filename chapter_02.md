    description: >
        Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack
        simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable
        parameters of a system to its input-output response. This chapter presents
        a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the
        Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the
        ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the
        behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA
        binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response.
