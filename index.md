    description: >
      The ability to adapt is central to the definition of 'Life'. Adaptation can
      be found across the biological scales, governing the nanosecond-scale
      conformational switching of proteins to millenia-long migrations. This
      website presents the text of my Ph.D. thesis in which I dissected adaptive
      processes at the molecular and organismal level. All research, unless
      otherwise stated, was performed at the California Institute of Technology
      under the guidance of <a href="http://rpgroup.caltech.edu/">Rob Phillips</a>.
