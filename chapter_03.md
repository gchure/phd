    description: >

        Here, I present a biophysical model of allosteric transcriptional regulation
        that directly links the location of a mutation within a repressor to the
        biophysical parameters that describe its behavior. Here, we explore the
        phenotypic space of a repressor with mutations in either the inducer
        binding or DNA binding domains. Using the LacI repressor in <i>Escherichia</i>
        <i>coli</i>, we make sharp, falsifiable predictions and use this framework to
        generate a null hypothesis for how double mutants behave, given knowledge of
        the single mutants. Linking mutations to the parameters which govern the
        system allows for quantitative predictions of how the free energy of the
        system changes as a result, permitting coarse graining of high-dimensional
        data into a single-parameter description of the mutational consequences.
