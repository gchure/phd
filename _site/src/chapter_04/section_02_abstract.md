## Abstract 

The intimate relationship between the environment and cellular growth rate
has remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a
century. Now, as it becomes possible to understand how the growth rate
dictates the wholesale reorganization of the intracellular molecular
composition, we can interrogate the biophysical principles underlying this
adaptive response. Regulation of gene expression drives this adaptation, with
changes in growth rate tied to the activation or repression of genes covering
enormous swaths of the genome. Here, we dissect how physiological
perturbations alter the expression of a circuit which has been extensively
characterized in a single physiological state. Given a complete thermodynamic
model, we map changes in physiology directly to the biophysical parameters
which define the expression. Controlling the growth rate via modulating the
available carbon source or growth temperature, we measure the level of gene
expression from a LacI-regulated promoter where the LacI copy number is
directly measured in each condition, permitting parameter-free prediction
of the expression level. The transcriptional output of this circuit is
remarkably robust, with expression of the repressor being largely insensitive
to the growth rate. The predicted gene expression quantitatively captures the
observations under different carbon conditions, indicating that the biophysical 
parameters are indifferent to the physiology. Interestingly,
temperature controls the expression level in ways that are inconsistent
with the prediction, revealing temperature-dependent effects that challenge
current models. This work exposes the strengths and weaknesses of
thermodynamic models in fluctuating environments, posing novel challenges and
utility in studying physiological adaptation.
