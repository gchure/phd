## Abstract
Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial
cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, *Escherichia
coli* and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels that
open and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In *E. coli*, one
of the most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large
conductance (MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through
structural methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our
understanding of its physiological role in preventing cell death by
alleviating high membrane tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine
the contribution of MscL alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at
single-cell resolution using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We
conducted these experiments in an *E. coli* strain which is lacking all
mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL, whose expression was tuned
across 3 orders of magnitude through modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence. While theoretical models suggest that only a few MscL channels
would be needed to alleviate even large changes in osmotic pressure, we find
that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are needed to convey upwards of
80\% survival. This number agrees with the average MscL copy number measured
in wild-type *E. coli* cells through proteomic studies and quantitative
Western blotting. Furthermore, we observed zero survival events in cells with
fewer than $\approx$ 100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions
concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival,
as well as regulation of their activity.
