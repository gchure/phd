## Topic I: An Introduction to Molecular Adaptation

Give a brief outline of the induction project and the underlying motivation to
develop a toy-model of the mechanisms of genetic regulation. Comment on the rich
dynamics of the central dogma machinery.

For a figure, show a detailed atomistic model of the Lac repressor alongside
the cartoon diagram. Use this as an opportunity to discuss a dream to
integrate over the high-dimensional space of molecular interactions and
coarse grain it into a simple cartoon. Show the simple cartoon of the
inducible simple repression motif alongside "prediction" curves and
"experiment" curves.

Briefly discuss how this chapter was built on an extensive degree of
collaboration and cooperation between scientists of different backgrounds and
styles. The rapid dissection of this process is only really possible through
the union of scientific perspectives.
