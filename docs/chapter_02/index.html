<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sec:ind_abstract" class="unnumbered">Abstract</h2>
<p>Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman- Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>50</sub></span>]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Understanding how organisms sense and respond to changes in their environment has long been a central theme of biological inquiry. At the cellular level, this interaction is mediated by a diverse collection of molecular signaling pathways. A pervasive mechanism of signaling in these pathways is allosteric regulation, in which the binding of a ligand induces a conformational change in some target molecule, triggering a signaling cascade <span class="citation" data-cites="lindsley2006a">(Lindsley and Rutter <a href="#ref-lindsley2006a" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. One of the most important examples of such signaling is offered by transcriptional regulation, where a transcription factor’s propensity to bind to DNA will be altered upon binding to an allosteric effector.</p>
<p>Despite allostery’s ubiquity, we lack a formal, rigorous, and generalizable framework for studying its effects across the broad variety of contexts in which it appears. A key example of this is transcriptional regulation, in which allosteric transcription factors can be induced or corepressed by binding to a ligand. An allosteric transcription factor can adopt multiple conformational states, each of which has its own affinity for the ligand and for its DNA target site. <em>In vitro</em> studies have rigorously quantified the equilibria of different conformational states for allosteric transcription factors and measured the affinities of these states to the ligand <span class="citation" data-cites="harman2001 lanfranco2017">(Harman <a href="#ref-harman2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Lanfranco et al. <a href="#ref-lanfranco2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. In spite of these experimental observations, the lack of a coherent quantitative model for allosteric transcriptional regulation has made it impossible to predict the behavior of even a simple genetic circuit across a range of regulatory parameters.</p>
<p>The ability to predict circuit behavior robustly— that is, across both broad ranges of parameters and regulatory architectures —is important for multiple reasons. First, in the context of a specific gene, accurate prediction demonstrates that all components relevant to the gene’s behavior have been identified and characterized to sufficient quantitative precision. Second, in the context of genetic circuits in general, robust prediction validates the model that generated the prediction. Possessing a validated model also has implications for future work. For example, when we have sufficient confidence in the model, a single data set can be used to accurately extrapolate a system’s behavior in other conditions. Moreover, there is an essential distinction between a predictive model, which is used to predict a system’s behavior given a set of input variables, and a retroactive model, which is used to describe the behavior of data that has already been obtained. We note that even some of the most careful and rigorous analysis of transcriptional regulation often entails only a retroactive reflection on a single experiment. This raises the fear that each regulatory architecture may require a unique analysis that cannot carry over to other systems, a worry that is exacerbated by the prevalent use of phenomenological functions (e.g. Hill functions or ratios of polynomials) that can analyze a single data set but cannot be used to extrapolate a system’s behavior in other conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="setty2003 poelwijk2011a vilar2013 rogers2015 rohlhill2017">(Setty et al. <a href="#ref-setty2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Poelwijk et al. <a href="#ref-poelwijk2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Vilar and Saiz <a href="#ref-vilar2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Rogers et al. <a href="#ref-rogers2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Rohlhill, Sandoval, and Papoutsakis <a href="#ref-rohlhill2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This work explores what happens when theory takes center stage, namely, we first write down the equations governing a system and describe its expected behavior across a wide array of experimental conditions, and only then do we set out to experimentally confirm these results. Building upon previous work <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011 brewster2014 weinert2014">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; Brewster et al. <a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Weinert et al. <a href="#ref-weinert2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> and the work of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <span class="citation" data-cites="monod1965">(Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <a href="#ref-monod1965" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a>)</span>, we present a statistical mechanical rendering of allostery in the context of induction and corepression (shown schematically in Fig. 1 and henceforth referred to as the MWC model) and use it as the basis of parameter-free predictions which we then test experimentally. More specifically, we study the simple repression motif – a widespread bacterial genetic regulatory architecture in which binding of a transcription factor occludes binding of an RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting transcription initiation. The MWC model stipulates that an allosteric protein fluctuates between two distinct conformations – an active and inactive state – in thermodynamic equilibrium <span class="citation" data-cites="monod1965">(Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <a href="#ref-monod1965" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a>)</span>. During induction, for example, effector binding increases the probability that a repressor will be in the inactive state, weakening its ability to bind to the promoter and resulting in increased expression. To test the predictions of our model across a wide range of operator binding strengths and repressor copy numbers, we design an <em>E. coli</em> genetic construct in which the binding probability of a repressor regulates gene expression of a fluorescent reporter.</p>
<p>In total, the work presented here demonstrates that one extremely compact set of parameters can be applied self-consistently and predictively to different regulatory situations including simple repression on the chromosome, cases in which decoy binding sites for repressor are put on plasmids, cases in which multiple genes compete for the same regulatory machinery, cases involving multiple binding sites for repressor leading to DNA looping, and induction by signaling <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011 garcia2011b brewster2012 brewster2014 boedicker2013a boedicker2013">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>, <a href="#ref-garcia2011b" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011b" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; Brewster, Jones, and Phillips <a href="#ref-brewster2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Brewster et al. <a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Boedicker et al. <a href="#ref-boedicker2013a" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Boedicker, Garcia, and Phillips <a href="#ref-boedicker2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> . Thus, rather than viewing the behavior of each circuit as giving rise to its own unique input-output response, the MWC model provides a means to characterize these seemingly diverse behaviors using a single unified framework governed by a small set of parameters.</p>

When bound, the repressor prevents RNAP from binding and initiating transcription. Induction is characterized by the addition of an effector which binds to the repressor and stabilizes the inactive state (defined as the state which has a low affinity for DNA), thereby increasing gene expression. In corepression, the effector stabilizes the repressor’s active state and thus further reduces gene expression. We list several characterized examples of induction and corepression that support different physiological roles in <span><em>E. coli</em></span> . A schematic regulatory response of the two architectures shown in Panel plotting the fold-change in gene expression as a function of effector concentration, where fold-change is defined as the ratio of gene expression in the presence versus the absence of repressor. We consider the following key phenotypic properties that describe each response curve: the minimum response (leakiness), the maximum response (saturation), the difference between the maximum and minimum response (dynamic range), the concentration of ligand which generates a fold-change halfway between the minimal and maximal response (<span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>), and the log-log slope at the midpoint of the response (effective Hill coefficient). (C) Over time we have refined our understanding of simple repression architectures. A first round of experiments used colorimetric assays and quantitative Western blots to investigate how single-site repression is modified by the repressor copy number and repressor-DNA binding energy . A second round of experiments used video microscopy to probe how the copy number of the promoter and presence of competing repressor binding sites affect gene expression, and we use this data set to determine the free energy difference between the repressor’s inactive and active conformations . Here we used flow cytometry to determine the inducer-repressor dissociation constants and demonstrate that with these parameters we can predict <em>a priori</em> the behavior of the system for any repressor copy number, DNA binding energy, gene copy number, and inducer concentration.</figcaption>

<p>We begin by considering a simple repression genetic architecture in which the binding of an allosteric repressor occludes the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the DNA <span class="citation" data-cites="ackers1982 buchler2003">(Ackers and Johnson <a href="#ref-ackers1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>; Buchler, Gerland, and Hwa <a href="#ref-buchler2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. When an effector (hereafter referred to as an “inducer” for the case of induction) binds to the repressor, it shifts the repressor’s allosteric equilibrium towards the inactive state as specified by the MWC model <span class="citation" data-cites="monod1965">(Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <a href="#ref-monod1965" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a>)</span>.

Simple repression motifs in the absence of inducer have been previously characterized by an equilibrium model where the probability of each state of repressor and RNAP promoter occupancy is dictated by the Boltzmann distribution <span class="citation" data-cites="ackers1982 buchler2003 vilar2003 bintu2005a garcia2011 brewster2014">(Ackers and Johnson <a href="#ref-ackers1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>; Buchler, Gerland, and Hwa <a href="#ref-buchler2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Vilar and Leibler <a href="#ref-vilar2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Bintu, Buchler, Garcia, Gerland, Hwa, Kondev, Kuhlman, et al. <a href="#ref-bintu2005a" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>; Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; Brewster et al. <a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> [we note that non-equilibrium models of simple repression have been shown to have the same functional form that we derive below <span class="citation" data-cites="phillips2015">(Phillips <a href="#ref-phillips2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>]. We extend these models to consider allostery by accounting for the equilibrium state of the repressor through the MWC model.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic models of gene expression begin by enumerating all possible states of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights. As shown in Fig. 2 (A), the promoter can either be empty, occupied by RNAP, or occupied by either an active or inactive repressor. The probability of binding to the promoter will be affected by the protein copy number, which we denote as <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> for RNAP, <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> for active repressor, and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> for inactive repressor. We note that repressors fluctuate between the active and inactive conformation in thermodynamic equilibrium, such that <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> will remain constant for a given inducer concentration <span class="citation" data-cites="monod1965">(Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <a href="#ref-monod1965" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a>)</span>. We assign the repressor a different DNA binding affinity in the active and inactive state. In addition to the specific binding sites at the promoter, we assume that there are <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>N</em><em>S</em></sub></span> non-specific binding sites elsewhere (i.e. on parts of the genome outside the simple repression architecture) where the RNAP or the repressor can bind. All specific binding energies are measured relative to the average non-specific binding energy. Thus, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> represents the energy difference between the specific and non-specific binding for RNAP to the DNA. Likewise, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>I</em></sub></span> represent the difference in specific and non-specific binding energies for repressor in the active or inactive state, respectively.</p>

Since inducer binding shifts the repressors from the active to the inactive state, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)</span> grows smaller as <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> increases .</p>
<p>We use the MWC model to compute the probability <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)</span> that a repressor with <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> inducer binding sites will be active. The value of <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)</span> is given by the sum of the weights of the active repressor states divided by the sum of the weights of all possible repressor states see 2 (B), namely,</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> represent the dissociation constant between the inducer and repressor in the active and inactive states, respectively, and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub> = <em>ε</em><sub><em>I</em></sub> − <em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> is the free energy difference between a repressor in the inactive and active state [the quantity <span class="math inline"><em>e</em><sup> − <em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></sup></span> is sometimes denoted by <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="monod1965 marzen2013">(Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <a href="#ref-monod1965" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a>; Marzen, Garcia, and Phillips <a href="#ref-marzen2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> or <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub>RR*</sub></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="daber2011a">(Daber, Sochor, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>].

<p>While we have used the specific case of simple repression with induction to craft this model, the same mathematics describe the case of corepression in which binding of an allosteric effector stabilizes the active state of the repressor and decreases gene expression (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, we shift from induction (governed by <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub> &lt; <em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>) to corepression (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub> &gt; <em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>) as the ligand transitions from preferentially binding to the inactive repressor state to stabilizing the active state. Furthermore, this general approach can be used to describe a variety of other motifs such as activation, multiple repressor binding sites, and combinations of activator and repressor binding sites <span class="citation" data-cites="bintu2005a brewster2014 weinert2014">(Bintu, Buchler, Garcia, Gerland, Hwa, Kondev, Kuhlman, et al. <a href="#ref-bintu2005a" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>; Brewster et al. <a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Weinert et al. <a href="#ref-weinert2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The formula presented in Eq. 5 enables us to make precise quantitative statements about induction profiles. Motivated by the broad range of predictions implied by Eq. 5, we designed a series of experiments using the <em>lac</em> system in <em>E. coli</em> to tune the control parameters for a simple repression genetic circuit. As discussed in Fig. 1 (C), previous studies from our lab have provided well-characterized values for many of the parameters in our experimental system, leaving only the values of the the MWC parameters (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>) to be determined. We note that while previous studies have obtained values for <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>L</em> = <em>e</em><sup> − <em>β</em><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></sup></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="ogorman1980 daber2011a">(O’Gorman et al. <a href="#ref-ogorman1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>; Daber, Sochor, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, they were either based upon biochemical experiments or <em>in vivo</em> conditions involving poorly characterized transcription factor copy numbers and gene copy numbers. These differences relative to our experimental conditions and fitting techniques led us to believe that it was important to perform our own analysis of these parameters. After inferring these three MWC parameters (see , Section “” for details regarding the inference of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>, which was fitted separately from <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>), we were able to predict the input/output response of the system under a broad range of experimental conditions. For example, this framework can predict the response of the system at different repressor copy numbers <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>, repressor-operator affinities <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, inducer concentrations <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, and gene copy numbers (see Chapter 7.2).</p>

<p>We test our model by predicting the induction profiles for an array of strains that could be made using previously characterized repressor copy numbers and DNA binding energies. Our approach contrasts with previous studies that have parameterized induction curves of simple repression motifs, as these have relied on expression systems where proteins are expressed from plasmids, resulting in highly variable and unconstrained copy numbers <span class="citation" data-cites="murphy2007 murphy2010 daber2009a daber2011a sochor2014">(Murphy, Balázsi, and Collins <a href="#ref-murphy2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="murphy2010"><strong>???</strong></span>; Daber, Sharp, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2009a" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Daber, Sochor, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Sochor <a href="#ref-sochor2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Instead, our approach relies on a foundation of previous work as depicted in Fig. <strong>¿fig:induction?</strong><em>types (C). This includes work from our laboratory that used </em>E. coli* constructs based on components of the <em>lac</em> system to demonstrate how the Lac repressor (LacI) copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> and operator binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em> * <em>R</em><em>A</em></span> affect gene expression in the absence of inducer <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="rydenfelt2014b">Rydenfelt et al.

(<a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, who modified this system to consider expression from multiple-copy plasmids as well as the presence of competing repressor binding sites.</p>
<p>The present study extends this body of work by introducing three additional biophysical parameters – <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> – which capture the allosteric nature of the transcription factor and complement the results shown by <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al.

(<a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Although the current work focuses on systems with a single site of repression, in the Materials and Methods, we utilize data from <span class="citation" data-cites="brewster2014">Brewster et al. (<a href="#ref-brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, in which multiple sites of repression are explored, to characterize the allosteric free energy difference <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> between the repressor’s active and inactive states. This additional data set is critical because multiple degenerate sets of parameters can characterize an induction curve equally well, with the <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> parameter compensated by the inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> (see Chapter 7, Supplementary Information). After fixing <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> as described in the Materials and Methods, we can use data from single-site simple repression systems to determine the values of <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>We determine the values of <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> by fitting to a single induction profile using Bayesian inferential methods <span class="citation" data-cites="sivia2006">(Sivia and Skilling <a href="#ref-sivia2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. We then use Eq. <strong>¿eq:foldchange_full?</strong> to predict gene expression for any concentration of inducer, repressor copy number, and DNA binding energy and compare these predictions against experimental measurements. To obtain induction profiles for a set of strains with varying repressor copy numbers, we used modified <em>lacI</em> ribosomal binding sites from <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al.

(<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. We note that <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> refers to the number of repressor dimers in the cell, which is twice the number of repressor tetramers reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al. (<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>; since both heads of the repressor are assumed to always be either specifically or non-specifically bound to the genome, the two repressor dimers in each LacI tetramer can be considered independently. Gene expression was measured using a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene, driven by a <em>lacUV5</em> promoter. Each of the six repressor copy number variants were paired with the native O1, O2, or O3 <em>lac</em> operator <span class="citation" data-cites="oehler1994">(Oehler et al. <a href="#ref-oehler1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> placed at the YFP transcription start site, thereby generating eighteen unique strains. The repressor-operator binding energies (O1 <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em> * <em>R</em><em>A</em> =  − 15.3 ± 0.2 <em>k</em> * <em>B</em><em>T</em></span>, O2 <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em> * <em>R</em><em>A</em> =  − 13.9 <em>k</em> * <em>B</em><em>T</em> ± 0.2</span>, and O3 <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em> * <em>R</em><em>A</em> =  − 9.7 ± 0.1 <em>k</em> * <em>B</em><em>T</em></span>) were previously inferred by measuring the fold-change of the <em>lac</em> system at different repressor copy numbers, where the error arises from model fitting <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. Additionally, we were able to obtain the value <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em> * <em>A</em><em>I</em> = 4.5 <em>k</em> * <em>B</em><em>T</em></span> by fitting to previous data as discussed in the Materials and Methods. We measure fold-change over a range of known IPTG concentrations <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, using <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 2</span> inducer binding sites per LacI dimer and approximating the number of non-specific binding sites as the length in base-pairs of the <em>E. coli</em> genome, <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>N</em><em>S</em></sub> = 4.6 × 10<sup>6</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Our experimental pipeline for determining fold-change using flow cytometry is shown in Fig. 3. Briefly, cells were grown to exponential phase, in which gene expression reaches steady state <span class="citation" data-cites="scott2010">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="scott2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, under concentrations of the inducer IPTG ranging between 0 and <span class="math inline">5000 <em>μ</em></span>M. We measure YFP fluorescence using flow cytometry and automatically gate the data to include only single-cell measurements (see Materials and Methods). To validate the use of flow cytometry, we also measured the fold-change of a subset of strains using the established method of single-cell microscopy (see Supplemental Information, Chapter 7). We found that the fold-change measurements obtained from microscopy were indistinguishable from that of flow-cytometry and yielded values for the inducer binding constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> that were within error.</p>

<p>The three parameters that we tune experimentally are shown in , leaving the three allosteric parameters (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>) to be determined by fitting.

Rather than fitting <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> to our entire data set of eighteen unique constructs, we performed Bayesian parameter estimation on data from a single strain with <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 260</span> and an O2 operator [<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 13.9 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>] shown in Fig. 4(D, orange points).

Unfortunately, we are not able to make a meaningful value-for-value comparison of our parameters to those of earlier studies <span class="citation" data-cites="daber2009a daber2011a">(Daber, Sharp, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2009a" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Daber, Sochor, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> because of uncertainties in both gene copy number and transcription factor copy numbers in these studies, as illustrated in Supplemental Chapter 7. We then predicted the fold-change for the remaining seventeen strains with no further fitting [see Fig. 4 (C - E)] together with the specific phenotypic properties described in and discussed in detail below [see Fig. <strong>¿fig:induciton_predictions?</strong> (F - J)].

<p>We stress that the entire suite of predictions in is based upon the induction profile of a single strain. Our ability to make such a broad range of predictions stems from the fact that our parameters of interest such as the repressor copy number and DNA binding energy - appear as distinct physical parameters within our model. While the single data set in Fig. 4 could also be fit using a Hill function, such an analysis would be unable to predict any of the other curves in the figure (see Materials &amp; Methods).

<h3 id="comparison-of-experimental-measurements-with-theoretical-predictions">Comparison of Experimental Measurements with Theoretical Predictions</h3>
<p>We tested the predictions shown in Fig. 4 by measuring fold-change induction profiles in strains with a broad range of repressor copy numbers and repressor binding energies as characterized in <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al. (<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. With a few notable exceptions, the results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate agreement between theory and experiment. We note that there was an apparently systematic shift in the O3 <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 9.7 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> strains Fig. 5 (C) and all of the <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1220</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1740</span> strains. This may be partially due to imprecise previous determinations of their <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> values. By performing a global fit where we infer all parameters including the repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> and the binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, we found better agreement for these strains, although a discrepancy in the steepness of the response for all O3 strains remains (see Materials &amp; Methods). We considered a number of hypotheses to explain these discrepancies such as including other states (e.g. non-negligible binding of the inactive repressor), relaxing the weak promoter approximation, and accounting for variations in gene and repressor copy number throughout the cell cycle, but none explained the observed discrepancies. As an additional test of our model, we considered strains using the synthetic Oid operator which exhibits an especially strong binding energy of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 17 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">(Garcia et al. <a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. The global fit agrees well with the Oid microscopy data, though it asserts a stronger Oid binding energy of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 17.7 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> (see Supplemental Chapter 7).</p>
<p>To ensure that the agreement between our predictions and data is not an accident of the strain we used to perform our fitting, we also inferred <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> from each of the other strains. As discussed in the Materials &amp; Methods and Fig. 4, the inferred values of <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> depend minimally upon which strain is chosen, indicating that these parameter values are highly robust. We also performed a global fit using the data from all eighteen strains in which we fitted for the inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>, the repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>, and the repressor DNA binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> (see Materials &amp; Methods). The resulting parameter values were nearly identical to those fitted from any single strain. For the remainder of the text we continue using parameters fitted from the strain with <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 260</span> repressors and an O2 operator.</p>

<p>A subset of the properties shown in Fig. 1 (i.e. the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and effective Hill coefficient) are of significant interest to synthetic biology. For example, synthetic biology is often focused on generating large responses (i.e. a large dynamic range) or finding a strong binding partner (i.e. a small <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>) <span class="citation" data-cites="brophy2014 shis2014">(Brophy and Voigt <a href="#ref-brophy2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Shis et al. <a href="#ref-shis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. While these properties are all individually informative, when taken together they capture the essential features of the induction response. We reiterate that a Hill function approach cannot predict these features <em>a priori</em> and furthermore requires fitting each curve individually. The MWC model, on the other hand, enables us to quantify how each trait depends upon a single set of physical parameters as shown by Fig. 4 (F-J).</p>
<p>We define these five phenotypic traits using expressions derived from the model presented in Eq. <strong>¿eq:foldchange_full?</strong>.

<p>These three properties are shown in Fig. 4 (F-H). We discuss these properties in greater detail in the Materials &amp; Methods section.

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Since the early work by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux , an array of biological phenomena has been tied to the existence of macromolecules that switch between inactive and active states. Examples can be found in a wide variety of cellular processes, including ligand-gated ion channels , enzymatic reactions , chemotaxis , quorum sensing , G-protein coupled receptors , physiologically important proteins , and beyond. One of the most ubiquitous examples of allostery is in the context of gene expression, where an array of molecular players bind to transcription factors to influence their ability to regulate gene activity . A number of studies have focused on developing a quantitative understanding of allosteric regulatory systems. analytically derived fundamental properties of the MWC model, including the leakiness and dynamic range described in this work, noting the inherent trade-offs in these properties when tuning the model’s parameters. Work in the Church and Voigt labs, among others, has expanded on the availability of allosteric circuits for synthetic biology . Recently, Daber <em>et al.</em> theoretically explored the induction of simple repression within the MWC model and experimentally measured how mutations alter the induction profiles of transcription factors . Vilar and Saiz analyzed a variety of interactions in inducible <em>lac</em>-based systems including the effects of oligomerization and DNA folding on transcription factor induction . Other work has attempted to use the <em>lac</em> system to reconcile <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> measurements .</p>
<p>Although this body of work has done much to improve our understanding of allosteric transcription factors, there have been few attempts to explicitly connect quantitative models to experiments. Here, we generate a predictive model of allosteric transcriptional regulation and then test the model against a thorough set of experiments using well-characterized regulatory components. Specifically, we used the MWC model to build upon a well-established thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation , allowing us to compose the model from a minimal set of biologically meaningful parameters. This model combines both theoretical and experimental insights; for example, rather than considering gene expression directly we analyze the fold-change in expression, where the weak promoter approximation (see ) circumvents uncertainty in the RNAP copy number. The resulting model depended upon experimentally accessible parameters, namely, the repressor copy number, the repressor-DNA binding energy, and the concentration of inducer. We tested these predictions on a range of strains whose repressor copy number spanned two orders of magnitude and whose DNA binding affinity spanned 6 <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span>. We argue that one would not be able to generate such a wide array of predictions by using a Hill function, which abstracts away the biophysical meaning of the parameters into phenomenological parameters .</p>
<p>More precisely, we tested our model in the context of a <em>lac</em>-based simple repression system by first determining the allosteric dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> from a single induction data set (O2 operator with binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 13.9 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> and repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 260</span>) and then using these values to make parameter-free predictions of the induction profiles for seventeen other strains where <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> were varied significantly (see ). We next measured the induction profiles of these seventeen strains using flow cytometry and found that our predictions consistently and accurately captured the primary features for each induction data set, as shown in -. Importantly, we find that fitting <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> to data from any other strain would have resulted in nearly identical predictions (see and , Section “”). This suggests that a few carefully chosen measurements can lead to a deep quantitative understanding of how simple regulatory systems work without requiring an extensive sampling of strains that span the parameter space. Moreover, the fact that we could consistently achieve reliable predictions after fitting only two free parameters stands in contrast to the common practice of fitting several free parameters simultaneously, which can nearly guarantee an acceptable fit provided that the model roughly resembles the system response, regardless of whether the details of the model are tied to any underlying molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>Beyond observing changes in fold-change as a function of effector concentration, our application of the MWC model allows us to explicitly predict the values of the induction curves’ key parameters, namely, the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and the effective Hill coefficient (see ). We are consistently able to accurately predict the leakiness, saturation, and dynamic range for each of the strains. For both the O1 and O2 data sets, our model also accurately predicts the effective Hill coefficient and <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, though these predictions for O3 are noticeably less accurate. While performing a global fit for all model parameters marginally improves the prediction for O3 (see , Section “”), we are still unable to accurately predict the effective Hill coefficient or the <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>. We further tried including additional states (such as allowing the inactive repressor to bind to the operator), relaxing the weak promoter approximation, accounting for changes in gene and repressor copy number throughout the cell cycle , and refitting the original binding energies from , but we were still unable to account for the O3 data. It remains an open question as to how the discrepancy between the theory and measurements for O3 can be reconciled.</p>
<p>The dynamic range, which is of considerable interest when designing or characterizing a genetic circuit, is revealed to have an interesting property: although changing the value of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> causes the dynamic range curves to shift to the right or left, each curve has the same shape and in particular the same maximum value. This means that strains with strong or weak binding energies can attain the same dynamic range when the value of <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> is tuned to compensate for the binding energy. This feature is not immediately apparent from the IPTG induction curves, which show very low dynamic ranges for several of the O1 and O3 strains. Without the benefit of models that can predict such phenotypic traits, efforts to engineer genetic circuits with allosteric transcription factors must rely on trial and error to achieve specific responses .</p>
<p>Despite the diversity observed in the induction profiles of each of our strains, our data are unified by their reliance on fundamental biophysical parameters. In particular, we have shown that our model for fold-change can be rewritten in terms of the free energy , which encompasses all of the physical parameters of the system. This has proven to be an illuminating technique in a number of studies of allosteric proteins . Although it is experimentally straightforward to observe system responses to changes in effector concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, framing the input-output function in terms of <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> can give the misleading impression that changes in system parameters lead to fundamentally altered system responses. Alternatively, if one can find the “natural variable” that enables the output to collapse onto a single curve, it becomes clear that the system’s output is not governed by individual system parameters, but rather the contributions of multiple parameters that define the natural variable. When our fold-change data are plotted against the respective free energies for each construct, they collapse cleanly onto a single curve (see ). This enables us to analyze how parameters can compensate each other. For example, rather than viewing strong repression as a consequence of low IPTG concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> or high repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>, we can now observe that strong repression is achieved when the free energy <span class="math inline"><em>F</em>(<em>c</em>) ≤  − 5<em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span>, a condition which can be reached in a number of ways.</p>
<p>While our experiments validated the theoretical predictions in the case of simple repression, we expect the framework presented here to apply much more generally to different biological instances of allosteric regulation. For example, we can use this model to study more complex systems such as when transcription factors interact with multiple operators . We can further explore different regulatory configurations such as corepression, activation, and coactivation, each of which are found in <em>E. coli</em> (see Appendix supplemental Chapter 6). This work can also serve as a springboard to characterize not just the mean but the full gene expression distribution and thus quantify the impact of noise on the system . Another extension of this approach would be to theoretically predict and experimentally verify whether the repressor-inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> or the energy difference <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> between the allosteric states can be tuned by making single amino acid substitutions in the transcription factor . Finally, we expect that the kind of rigorous quantitative description of the allosteric phenomenon provided here will make it possible to construct biophysical models of fitness for allosteric proteins similar to those already invoked to explore the fitness effects of transcription factor binding site strengths and protein stability .</p>
<p>To conclude, we find that our application of the MWC model provides an accurate, predictive framework for understanding simple repression by allosteric transcription factors. To reach this conclusion, we analyzed the model in the context of a well-characterized system, in which each parameter had a clear biophysical meaning. As many of these parameters had been measured or inferred in previous studies, this gave us a minimal model with only two free parameters which we inferred from a single data set. We then accurately predicted the behavior of seventeen other data sets in which repressor copy number and repressor-DNA binding energy were systematically varied. In addition, our model allowed us to understand how key properties such as the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and effective Hill coefficient depended upon the small set of parameters governing this system. Finally, we show that by framing inducible simple repression in terms of free energy, the data from all of our experimental strains collapse cleanly onto a single curve, illustrating the many ways in which a particular output can be targeted. In total, these results show that a thermodynamic formulation of the MWC model supersedes phenomenological fitting functions for understanding transcriptional regulation by allosteric proteins.</p>

<p>All strains used in these experiments were derived from <em>E. coli</em> K12 MG1655 with the <em>lac</em> operon removed, adapted from those created and described in <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al.

Briefly, the operator variants and YFP reporter gene were cloned into a pZS25 background which contains a <em>lacUV5</em> promoter that drives expression as is shown schematically in Fig. 2. These constructs carried a kanamycin resistance gene and were integrated into the <em>galK</em> locus of the chromosome using <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> Red recombineering <span class="citation" data-cites="sharan2009">Sharan et al.

(<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. These <em>lacI</em> constructs carried a chloramphenicol resistance gene and were integrated into the <em>ybcN</em> locus of the chromosome. Final strain construction was achieved by performing repeated P1 transduction <span class="citation" data-cites="thomason2007">(Thomason, Costantino, and Court <a href="#ref-thomason2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> of the different operator and <em>lacI</em> constructs to generate each combination used in this work. Integration was confirmed by PCR amplification of the replaced chromosomal region and by sequencing. Primers and final strain genotypes are listed in supplemental Chapter 7.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the rest of the <em>lac</em> operon (<em>lacZYA</em>) was never expressed. The LacY protein is a transmembrane protein which actively transports lactose as well as IPTG into the cell. As LacY was never produced in our strains, we assume that the extracellular and intracellular IPTG concentration was approximately equal due to diffusion across the membrane into the cell as is suggested by previous work <span class="citation" data-cites="fernandez-castane2012">(Fernández-Castané et al. <a href="#ref-fernandez-castane2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To make this theory applicable to transcription factors with any number of DNA binding domains, we used a different definition for repressor copy number than has been used previously. We define the LacI copy number as the average number of repressor dimers per cell whereas in <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al. (<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, the copy number is defined as the average number of repressor tetramers in each cell. To motivate this decision, we consider the fact that the LacI repressor molecule exists as a tetramer in <em>E. coli</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="lewis1996">(Lewis et al. <a href="#ref-lewis1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> in which a single DNA binding domain is formed from dimerization of LacI proteins, so that wild-type LacI might be described as dimer of dimers. Since each dimer is allosterically independent (i.e. either dimer can be allosterically active or inactive, independent of the configuration of the other dimer) <span class="citation" data-cites="daber2009a">(Daber, Sharp, and Lewis <a href="#ref-daber2009a" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, a single LacI tetramer can be treated as two functional repressors. Therefore, we have simply multiplied the number of repressors reported in <span class="citation" data-cites="garcia2011">Garcia et al. (<a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a><a href="#ref-garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> by a factor of two. This factor is included as a keyword argument in the numerous Python functions used to perform this analysis, as discussed in the code documentation.</p>
<p>A subset of strains in these experiments were measured using fluorescence microscopy for validation of the flow cytometry data and results. To aid in the high-fidelity segmentation of individual cells, the strains were modified to constitutively express an mCherry fluorophore. This reporter was cloned into a pZS4*1 backbone <span class="citation" data-cites="lutz1997">(Lutz and Bujard <a href="#ref-lutz1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> in which mCherry is driven by the <em>lacUV5</em> promoter. All microscopy and flow cytometry experiments were performed using these strains.</p>
<h3 id="growth-conditions-for-flow-cytometry-measurements">Growth Conditions for Flow Cytometry Measurements</h3>
<p>All measurements were performed with <em>E. coli</em> cells grown to mid-exponential phase in standard M9 minimal media (M9 5X Salts, Sigma-Aldrich M6030; <span class="math inline">2 mM</span> magnesium sulfate, Mallinckrodt Chemicals 6066-04; <span class="math inline">100 <em>μ</em>M</span> calcium chloride, Fisher Chemicals C79-500) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose. Briefly, <span class="math inline">500 <em>μ</em>L</span> cultures of <em>E. coli</em> were inoculated into Lysogeny Broth (LB Miller Powder, BD Medical) from a 50% glycerol frozen stock (-80<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span>C) and were grown overnight in a <span class="math inline">2 mL</span> 96-deep-well plate sealed with a breathable nylon cover (Lab Pak - Nitex Nylon, Sefar America Inc. Cat.

After approximately <span class="math inline">12</span> to <span class="math inline">15</span> hours, the cultures had reached saturation and were diluted 1000-fold into a second <span class="math inline">2 mL</span> 96-deep-well plate where each well contained <span class="math inline">500 <em>μ</em>L</span> of M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5% w/v glucose (anhydrous D-Glucose, Macron Chemicals) and the appropriate concentration of IPTG (Isopropyl <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside Dioxane Free, Research Products International). These were sealed with a breathable cover and were allowed to grow for approximately eight hours. Cells were then diluted ten-fold into a round-bottom 96-well plate (Corning Cat. No. 3365) containing <span class="math inline">90 <em>μ</em>L</span> of M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5% w/v glucose along with the corresponding IPTG concentrations. For each IPTG concentration, a stock of 100-fold concentrated IPTG in double distilled water was prepared and partitioned into <span class="math inline">100 <em>μ</em>L</span> aliquots. The same parent stock was used for all experiments described in this work.</p>
<h3 id="flow-cytometry">Flow Cytometry</h3>
<p>Unless explicitly mentioned, all fold-change measurements were collected on a Miltenyi Biotec MACSquant Analyzer 10 Flow Cytometer graciously provided by the Pamela Björkman lab at Caltech. Detailed information regarding the voltage settings of the photo-multiplier detectors can be found in the supplemental Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Prior to each day’s experiments, the analyzer was calibrated using MACSQuant Calibration Beads (Cat. No. 130-093-607) such that day-to-day experiments would be comparable. All YFP fluorescence measurements were collected via <span class="math inline">488 nm</span> laser excitation coupled with a 525/<span class="math inline">50 nm</span> emission filter. Unless otherwise specified, all measurements were taken over the course of two to three hours using automated sampling from a 96-well plate kept at approximately <span class="math inline">$4^\circ \, \hbox{-} \, 10^\circ$</span>C on a MACS Chill 96 Rack (Cat.

Cells were diluted to a final concentration of approximately <span class="math inline">4 × 10<sup>4</sup></span> cells per <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em>L</span> which corresponded to a flow rate of 2,000-6,000 measurements per second, and acquisition for each well was halted after 100,000 events were detected. Once completed, the data were extracted and immediately processed using the following methods.</p>
<h3 id="unsupervised-gating-of-flow-cytometry-data">Unsupervised Gating of Flow Cytometry Data</h3>
<p>Flow cytometry data will frequently include a number of spurious events or other undesirable data points such as cell doublets and debris. The process of restricting the collected data set to those data determined to be “real” is commonly referred to as gating. These gates are typically drawn manually and restrict the data set to those points which display a high degree of linear correlation between their forward-scatter (FSC) and side-scatter (SSC). The development of unbiased and unsupervised methods of drawing these gates is an active area of research . For our purposes, we assume that the fluorescence level of the population should be log-normally distributed about some mean value. With this assumption in place, we developed a method that allows us to restrict the data used to compute the mean fluorescence intensity of the population to the smallest two-dimensional region of the <span class="math inline">log (<em>F</em><em>S</em><em>C</em>)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">log (<em>S</em><em>S</em><em>C</em>)</span> space in which 40% of the data is found. This was performed by fitting a bivariate Gaussian distribution and restricting the data used for calculation to those that reside within the 40th percentile. This procedure is described in more detail in the supplemental Chapter 7.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-determination-of-fold-change">Experimental Determination of Fold-Change</h3>
<p>For each strain and IPTG concentration, the fold-change in gene expression was calculated by taking the ratio of the population mean YFP expression in the presence of LacI repressor to that of the population mean in the absence of LacI repressor. However, the measured fluorescence intensity of each cell also includes the autofluorescence contributed by the weak excitation of the myriad protein and small molecules within the cell. To correct for this background, we computed the fold change as</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\text{fold-change} = \frac{\langle I_{R &gt; 0} \rangle - \langle I_\text{auto}\rangle}{\langle I_{R = 0} \rangle - \langle I_\text{auto}\rangle},$</span>{#eq:induction_image_def}</p>

<p><span id="eq:induction_bayes"><br /><span class="math display">$$P(K_A, K_I \,\vert\, D) = \frac{P(D \,\vert\, K_A, K_I)P(K_A, K_I)}{P(D)},
\qquad(11)$$</span><br /></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> is all the data composed of independent variables (repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>, repressor-DNA binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, and inducer concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>) and one dependent variable (experimental fold-change). <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em> ∣ <em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>, <em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub>)</span> is the likelihood of having observed the data given the parameter values for the dissociation constants, <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>, <em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub>)</span> contains all the prior information on these parameters, and <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em>)</span> serves as a normalization constant, which we can ignore in our parameter estimation. Eq. <strong>¿eq:fold_change_Full?</strong> assumes a deterministic relationship between the parameters and the data, so in order to construct a probabilistic relationship as required by Eq. 11, we assume that the experimental fold-change for the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sup>th</sup></span> datum given the parameters is of the form</p>
<p><span id="eq:induction_fold_change_experimental"><br /><span class="math display">$$
\text{fold-change}_\text{exp}^{(i)} = \left( 1 + \frac{\left(1 +
\frac{c^{(i)}}{K_A}\right)^2}{\left( 1 + \frac{c^{(i)}}{K_A}\right)^2 +
e^{-\beta \Delta \varepsilon_{AI}} \left(1 + \frac{c^{(i)}}{K_I} \right)^2} \frac{R^{(i)}}{N_{NS}} e^{-\beta
\Delta \varepsilon_{RA}^{(i)}}\right)^{-1} + \epsilon^{(i)},
\qquad(12)$$</span><br /></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em><sup>(<em>i</em>)</sup></span> represents the departure from the deterministic theoretical prediction for the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sup>th</sup></span> data point. If we assume that these <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em><sup>(<em>i</em>)</sup></span> errors are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>, the likelihood of the data given the parameters is of the form</p>
<p><span id="eq:likelihood"><br /><span class="math display">$$
P(D \vert K_A, K_I, \sigma) =
\frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{\frac{n}{2}}}\prod\limits_{i=1}^n \exp 
\left[-\frac{(\text{fold-change}^{(i)}_\text{exp} - \text{fold-change}(K_A, K_I, R^{(i)},
    \Delta\varepsilon_{RA}^{(i)}, c^{(i)}))^2}{2\sigma^2}\right],
\qquad(13)$$</span><br /></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">fold-change<sub>exp</sub><sup>(<em>i</em>)</sup></span> is the experimental fold-change and <span class="math inline">fold-change( ⋯)</span> is the theoretical prediction. The product <span class="math inline">$\prod_{i=1}^n$</span> captures the assumption that the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> data points are independent. Note that the likelihood and prior terms now include the extra unknown parameter <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>. In applying Eq. 13, a choice of <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> that provides better agreement between theoretical fold-change predictions and experimental measurements will result in a more probable likelihood.</p>
<p>Both mathematically and numerically, it is convenient to define <span class="math inline">$\tilde{k}_A = -\log \frac{K_A}{1\,\text{M}}$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\tilde{k}_I = -\log \frac{K_I}{1\,\text{M}}$</span> and fit for these parameters on a log scale. Dissociation constants are scale invariant, so that a change from <span class="math inline">10 <em>μ</em>M</span> to <span class="math inline">1 <em>μ</em>M</span> leads to an equivalent increase in affinity as a change from <span class="math inline">1 <em>μ</em>M</span> to <span class="math inline">0.1 <em>μ</em>M</span>. With these definitions we assume for the prior <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>k̃</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>, <em>k̃</em><sub><em>I</em></sub>, <em>σ</em>)</span> that all three parameters are independent. In addition, we assume a uniform distribution for <span class="math inline"><em>k̃</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>k̃</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> and a Jeffreys prior for the scale parameter <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>. This yields the complete prior</p>
<p><span id="eq:induction_prior"><br /><span class="math display">$$P(\tilde{k}_A, \tilde{k}_I, \sigma) \equiv \frac{1}{(\tilde{k}_A^{\max} -
\tilde{k}_A^{\min})} \frac{1}{(\tilde{k}_I^{\max} -
\tilde{k}_I^{\min})}\frac{1}{\sigma}.
\qquad(14)$$</span><br /></span></p>
<p>These priors are maximally uninformative meaning that they imply no prior knowledge of the parameter values. We defined the <span class="math inline"><em>k̃</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>k̃</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> ranges uniform on the range of <span class="math inline"> − 7</span> to <span class="math inline">7</span>, although we note that this particular choice does not affect the outcome provided the chosen range is sufficiently wide.</p>
<p>Putting all these terms together we can now sample from <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>k̃</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>, <em>k̃</em><sub><em>I</em></sub>, <em>σ</em> ∣ <em>D</em>)</span> using Markov chain Monte Carlo to compute the most likely parameter as well as the error bars (given by the 95% credible region) for <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>.</p>
