### Experimental Setup
Seminal studies from the burgeoning years of bacterial physiology have
demonstrated a strong dependence of the total cellular protein content on the
growth rate [@schaechter1958], a relationship which has been rigorously
quantified in recent years using mass spectrometry [@schmidt2016] and
ribosomal profiling [@li2014]. Their combined results illustrate that
modulation of the growth rate, either through controlling the available
carbon source or the temperature of the growth medium, significantly alters
the physiological state of the cell, triggering the reallocation of resources
to prioritize expression of ribosome-associated genes. @Eq:foldchange_simple
has no explicit dependence on the available carbon source,  but does depend on
the temperature through the energetic parameters $\Delta\varepsilon_{R}$ and
$\Delta\varepsilon_{AI}$ which are defined relative to the thermal energy,
$k_BT$. With this parametric knowledge, we are able to draw quantitative
predictions of the fold-change in gene expression in these physiologically
distinct states.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We modulated growth of *Escherichia coli* by
varying either the quality of the available carbon source (differing ATP
yield per C atom) or the temperature of the growth medium
(@Fig:growth_control (A)). All experiments were performed in a defined M9
minimal medium supplemented with one of three carbon sources – glucose,
glycerol, or acetate – at concentrations such that the total number of carbon
atoms available to the culture remained the same. These carbon sources have
been shown to drastically alter growth rate and gene expression profiles,
indicating changes in the proteomic composition and distinct physiological
states. These carbon sources yield an approximate four-fold modulation of the
growth rate with doubling times ranging from $\approx$ 220 minutes to
$\approx$ 65 minutes in an acetate or glucose supplemented medium,
respectively [@Fig:growth_control (B) and (C)]. While the growth temperature
was varied over 10$^\circ$ C, both 32$^\circ$ and 42$^\circ$ C result in
approximately the same doubling time of $\approx$ 90 min, which is 1.5 times
slower than the optimal temperature of 37$^\circ$ C (@Fig:growth_control (B)
and (C)).

physiological state of *E. coli* via growth rate modulation by environmental
factors."}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth rate dependence of the proteome
composition suggests that changing physiological conditions could change the
total repressor copy number of the cell. As emphasized in Chapter 2, it can
be difficult to differentiate between a change in repressor copy number $R$
and the allosteric energy difference $\Delta\varepsilon_{AI}$ as there are
many combinations of parameter values that yield the same fold-change. To
combat this degeneracy, we used a genetically engineered strain of *E. coli*
in which the expression of the repressor copy number and its regulated gene
product (YFP) can be simultaneously measured. This strain, used previously to
interrogate the transcription factor titration effect [@brewster2014], is
diagrammed in @Fig:dilution_circuit (A). A dimeric form of the LacI repressor
N-terminally tagged with an mCherry fluorophore is itself regulated through
the action of the TetR repressor whose level of activity can be modulated
through the addition of the allosteric effector anhydrous tetracycline (ATC).
This dual repression genetic circuit allows for the expression of the LacI
repressor to be tuned over several orders of magnitude. This is demonstrated
in @Fig:dilution_circuit (B) where a titration of ATC in the growth
medium results in a steady increase in the expression of the LacI-mCherry
gene product (red lines and points) which in turn represses expression of the
YFP reporter (yellow lines and points).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the mCherry fluorescence is proportional
to the repressor copy number, it is not a direct measurement as the
fluorescence of a single LacI-mCherry dimer is unknown *a priori*. Using
video microscopy, we measure the partitioning statistics of the fluorescence
intensity into two sibling cells after division (@Fig:dilution_circuit (C)).
This method, described in detail in the Materials \& Methods as well as in
@rosenfeld2002, @rosenfeld2005, and @brewster2014, reveals a linear
relationship between the variance in intensity between two sibling cells and
the intensity of the parent cell, the slope of which is equal to the
brightness of a single LacI repressor. Since this measurement is performed
simultaneously with measurement of the expression of the YFP reporter, this
calibration factor was determined for each unique experimental replicate. We
direct the reader to the supplemental Chapter 8 for a more thorough
discussion of this inference.

![**Control and quantification of repressor copy number.** (A) The dual
repression expression system. The inducible repressor TetR (purple blob) is
expressed from a low-copy-number plasmid in the cell and represses expression
of the LacI-mCherry repressor by binding to its cognate operator (tetO). In
the presence of anhydrous tetracycline (ATC, green sphere), the inactive
state of TetR becomes energetically favorable, permitting expression of the
LacI-mCherry construct (red). This in turn binds to the lacO operator
sequence repressing the expression of the reporter Yellow Fluorescent Protein
(YFP, yellow lightbulb). (B) An ATC titration curve showing anticorrelated
YFP (yellow) and mCherry (red) intensities. Reported values are scaled to
the maximum mean fluorescence for each channel. Points and errors correspond
to the mean and standard error of eight biological replicates. (C)
Determination of a fluorescence calibration factor. After cessation of
LacI-mCherry expression, cells are allowed to divide, partitioning the
fluorescently tagged LacI repressors into the two daughter cells (left
panel). The total intensity of the parent cell is equivalent to the summed
intensities of the daughters. The squared fluctuations in intensity of the
two sibling cells is linearly related to the parent cell with a slope $\alpha$,
which is the fluorescence signal measured per partitioned repressor (right
panel). Black points represent single divisions and red points are the means
of 50 division events. Line corresponds to linear fit to the black points
with a slope of $\alpha = 740 \pm 40$ a.u. per LacI.  The Python codes
