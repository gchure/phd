## Introduction

From archaea thriving in hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor to aspen trees
dominating a Coloradan mountainside, all forms of life are unified in their
obedience to the forces of evolution. The influence of evolution is ubiquitous
across time and length scales, shaping billions of years of speciation,
thousand-year-long migration patterns, and nanosecond-scale conformational
changes of proteins alike.
