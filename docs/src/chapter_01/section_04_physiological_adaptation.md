## Topic IV: The Physiological Adaptability of Transient Molecular Interactions

![**A metabolic hierarchy in a three-component growth mixture of glucose,
sorbitol, and glycerol.** A "triauxic" growth curve illustrating a hierarchy of
carbon source metabolism. An *E. coli* culture was grown in an medium with equal
parts glucose, sorbitol and glycerol with utilization in that order. Auxic
transitions are shown as black points and white vertical lines. Regions of the
growth curve where glucose, sorbitol, and glycrol are primarily consumed are
colored in blue, orange, and green, respectively. Data digitized from
