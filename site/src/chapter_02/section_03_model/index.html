<p>We begin by considering a simple repression genetic architecture in which the binding of an allosteric repressor occludes the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the DNA . When an effector (hereafter referred to as an “inducer” for the case of induction) binds to the repressor, it shifts the repressor’s allosteric equilibrium towards the inactive state as specified by the MWC model . This causes the repressor to bind more weakly to the operator, which increases gene expression. Simple repression motifs in the absence of inducer have been previously characterized by an equilibrium model where the probability of each state of repressor and RNAP promoter occupancy is dictated by the Boltzmann distribution (we note that non-equilibrium models of simple repression have been shown to have the same functional form that we derive below ). We extend these models to consider allostery by accounting for the equilibrium state of the repressor through the MWC model.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic models of gene expression begin by enumerating all possible states of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights. As shown in [<a href="#fig:ind_states_weights">1</a>], the promoter can either be empty, occupied by RNAP, or occupied by either an active or inactive repressor. The probability of binding to the promoter will be affected by the protein copy number, which we denote as <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> for RNAP, <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> for active repressor, and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> for inactive repressor. We note that repressors fluctuate between the active and inactive conformation in thermodynamic equilibrium, such that <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> will remain constant for a given inducer concentration . We assign the repressor a different DNA binding affinity in the active and inactive state. In addition to the specific binding sites at the promoter, we assume that there are <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>N</em><em>S</em></sub></span> non-specific binding sites elsewhere (i.e. on parts of the genome outside the simple repression architecture) where the RNAP or the repressor can bind. All specific binding energies are measured relative to the average non-specific binding energy. Thus, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> represents the energy difference between the specific and non-specific binding for RNAP to the DNA. Likewise, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>I</em></sub></span> represent the difference in specific and non-specific binding energies for repressor in the active or inactive state, respectively.</p>

<p>Thermodynamic models of transcription posit that gene expression is proportional to the probability that the RNAP is bound to the promoter <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>bound</sub></span>, which is given by</p>
<p><span id="eq:pbound_def" class="eqnos"><br /><span class="math display">$$
p_\text{bound}=\frac{\frac{P}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta
\Delta\varepsilon_{P}}}{1+\frac{R_A}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta
\Delta\varepsilon_{RA}}+\frac{R_I}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta
\Delta\varepsilon_{RI}}+\frac{P}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta\Delta\varepsilon_{P}}},
$$</span><br /><span class="eqnos-number">(1)</span></span> </p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">$\beta = \frac{1}{k_BT}$</span> where <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> is the Boltzmann constant and <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> is the temperature of the system. As <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> is the natural unit of energy at the molecular length scale, we treat the products <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> as single parameters within our model. Measuring <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>bound</sub></span> directly is fraught with experimental difficulties, as determining the exact proportionality between expression and <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>bound</sub></span> is not straightforward. Instead, we measure the fold-change in gene expression due to the presence of the repressor. We define fold-change as the ratio of gene expression in the presence of repressor relative to expression in the absence of repressor (i.e. constitutive expression), namely,</p>
<p><span id="eq:ind_fc_def" class="eqnos"><br /><span class="math display">$$
\text{fold-change} \equiv \frac{p_\text{bound}(R &gt; 0)}{p_\text{bound}(R = 0)}.
$$</span><br /><span class="eqnos-number">(2)</span></span></p>
<p>We can simplify this expression using two well-justified approximations: (1) <span class="math inline">$\frac{P}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta\Delta\varepsilon_{P}}\ll 1$</span> implying that the RNAP binds weakly to the promoter (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>N</em><em>S</em></sub> = 4.6 × 10<sup>6</sup></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>P</em> ≈ 10<sup>3</sup></span> , <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> ≈  − 2  to  − 5 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> , so that <span class="math inline">$\frac{P}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta\Delta\varepsilon_{P}} \approx 0.01$</span>) and (2) <span class="math inline">$\frac{R_I}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta \Delta\varepsilon_{RI}} \ll 1 + \frac{R_A}{N_{NS}} e^{-\beta\Delta\varepsilon_{RA}}$</span> which reflects our assumption that the inactive repressor binds weakly to the promoter of interest. Using these approximations, the fold-change reduces to the form</p>
<p><span id="eq:ind_fc_appx" class="eqnos"><br /><span class="math display">$$
\text{fold-change} \approx \left(1+\frac{R_A}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta

\frac{R}{N_{NS}}e^{-\beta

<p>where in the last step we have introduced the fraction <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)</span> of repressors in the active state given a concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> of inducer, such that <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>(<em>c</em>) = <em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)<em>R</em></span>. Since inducer binding shifts the repressors from the active to the inactive state, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>act</sub>(<em>c</em>)</span> grows smaller as <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> increases.</p>
